# Wordle "AI"

This project has an "AI" that plays the Wordle game. The flow is simple, the frontend types a word in the game and collects which letters are right, wrong or misplaced. Then a request to the backend is made which returns the recommended word. That word is typed in the frontend and the process repeats itself until the game is either won or lost.

I have a YouTube video for this [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNjyqR75WN0).
